Honour for UK games maker  Leading British computer games maker Peter Molyneux has been made an OBE in the New Year Honours list.The head of Surrey's Lionhead Studios was granted the honour for services to the computer games industry.Mr Molyneux has been behind many of the ground-breaking games of the last 15 years such as Populous, Theme Park, Dungeon Keeper and Black and White.Speaking to the BBC News website Mr Molyneux said receiving the honour was something of a surprise."It was thought to be like skateboarding," he said, "a craze that everyone thought would go away"."Britain plays a big part in it," he said.His career started at Bullfrog Studios which in 1987 produced Populous one of the first God-games."I thought everyone would treat Populous as weird," he said, "but it became a huge international success".He left Bullfrog in 1997 to set up Lionhead Studios which was behind the ambitous and widely acclaimed game Black & White.One of the next titles to come from Lionhead puts players in charge of a movie studio and tasks them with producing and directing a hit film.
