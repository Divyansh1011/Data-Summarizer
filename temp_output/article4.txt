High fuel prices hit BA's profits  British Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.3%.BA's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1."For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated," BA chairman Martin Broughton said.BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's latest quarterly results as "pretty modest"."It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong," he said.Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive.BA's shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.
