Hewitt decries 'career sexism'  Plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid.Ms Hewitt told the seminar: "Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months."We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that".The minister told delegates that getting rid of "career sexism" was vital to closing the gender pay gap."Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential."Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry.Construction is even worse."But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men."The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning.For women working part-time it is 60p".The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.
