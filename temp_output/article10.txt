Architecture has taken different styles throughout time, from ancient times to the present days.Among the aspects to be considered include architectural designs, construction methods, and building material, distinct aspects in the building designs, both interior and exterior (Craven, 2020).I will consider highlighting the significant element of the culture of the people whole built these buildings.The building was greatly politically influenced to provide a symbol of the reign of power, a visible and tangible efflorescence of the Athenian Empire and supremacy.It built classical order architecture with major aspects of the Doric style majorly, but it also combines Ionic and Corinthian orders.The building bears distinct exterior features such as symmetry columns, balance, and harmony in the structures.There were interior rooms that were larger and hosted the statue of the cult.The building also bared pedimental sculptures that represented various iconic events in the history of Athens.Among the great captured by the sculptures was the great birth of Athena captured from Zeusâ€™ head.The frieze depicted the procession of men on horses, sacrificial animals, musicians, and other important figures who were charged with important roles in ritual activities.The frieze eastern side of the temple was a sculpture of a child handing a folded piece of cloth to an old age man.It was primarily constructed to host religious ceremonies and rituals.It had its entrances aligned with six columns that bared the Ionic order.The one located in the northwest corner was supported by Ionic columns called Prostaseis that stood tall (Hall, 2021).The southwest porch was supported by six female statues called Caryatids that were massively reinforced.It was also decorated with frescoes, rosettes, and arrays of colored features accompanied by sculptures near the floor.These two buildings are from Ancient Greece.The two buildings were influenced by religion and leadership at the time.They were engineered and designed to host large congregations for religious and political purposes.
