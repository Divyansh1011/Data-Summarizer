Viewers to be able to shape TV  Imagine editing Titanic down to watch just your favourite bits or cutting out the slushier moments of Star Wars to leave you with a bare bones action-fest.1m) project funded by the European Union.New Media for a New Millennium (NM2) will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre, which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes.Viewers will be able to participate in storylines, manipulate plots and even the sets and props of TV shows.BT is one of 13 partners involved in the project.It will be contributing software that was originally designed to spot anomalies in CCTV pictures.The software uses content recognition algorithms.The three-year project will work on seven productions as it develops a set of software tools that will allow viewers to edit content to their needs.It is being developed in Finland and will be shown to Finnish TV audiences.NM2's co-ordinator Peter Stollenmayer explained that the new genre would radically alter the role of the audience."Media users will no longer be passive viewers but become active engagers".It will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said John Wyver, from TV producer Illuminations Television Limited, which is also involved in the project."It's not just a matter of stringing together the romantic or action portions of a production," said Mr Wyver."The tool has to know which bits fit together both visually, by observing the time-honoured rules that go in editing, and in terms of the story".Mr Wyver is planning a production entitled The Golden Age, about Renaissance art.
