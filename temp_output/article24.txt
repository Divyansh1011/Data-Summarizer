Losing yourself in online gaming  Online role playing games are time-consuming, but enthralling flights from reality.But are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously?When video game World of Warcraft hit the shops in Europe last week fans wrote in to the BBC website to express their delight - and to offer a warning."An addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time," wrote Travis Anderson, in Texas.But some struck a more worrying tone about the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG): "'You need to get out more' could be the motto of any MMORPG.Scare-mongering articles about "addictive video games" have existed since the days the first game of Pong stopped everyone from working at the Atari offices.Unfortunately, gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make.Massively multiplayer online role playing games - MMORPGs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds.The scope of these games - like Warcraft, EverQuest, Ultima among others - is epic, and exploration and adventure is almost infinite.Part of the "problem" is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded, mindless tasks, to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure.E Hayot, writing in the culture blogzine Print Culture, said recently: "I used to play the online role-playing game EverQuest a lot.He says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour "wasn't that unusual; lots of people I knew in the game played EQ that much".He quit the game, he says, because he realised life was more fun than EverQuest.But the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far.The thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by EverQuest can be found on one blog EverQuest Daily Grind."I am actually convinced at this point that there are more than 'some' people who spend more times in MMOPRGs than in reality," she said."I can't talk to him while he is playing..ya' a few minutes after I ask him a question".But for some it is not in the least funny.And some of them are even sadder: "Today our son was five days old.Video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised.I wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but I think it probably isn't.I know of people who are spending their week's holiday from work playing Warcraft..waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they 'needed' to appear.By all standards many of us are addicts..I have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began, games have become more and more complex.I think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct.I have, about a year ago, deleted every game on my computer.Unlike books, or perhaps even TV, you gain absolutely nothing.Despite having little monetary value, the "rewards" and encouragement offered by these MMORPGs is enough to hook games for hours daily.Perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality?If he wants to play as well, well at least you'll be together somewhere..I still play now, but without the guilt , hehe, How long have i played in one sitting?Now, thankfully the fascination has worn off and I have a girlfriend but still no job.Obsessive behaviour is, of course, always cause for concern, but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of "reality".This problem, however, has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality.If MMORPGs have a unique danger, in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour, it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world, but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7.The problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming, but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture.A few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday..One particular session started at about 2pm on a Sunday, paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the Monday and after visit to University for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session.I would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that.It came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one.When I was made redundant I told my partner I had a new job for three months whilst every day I played EverQuest from 7:30am till 5:pm.When She came home I pretended I had just got in as well, hence justifying playing it all evening.I have since quit playing MMORPG and have a good job.When I got to the point where I was eating my dinner in front of the PC I realised things were getting silly so I'm trying not to spend so much time on there.I feel as if I've got a real addiction going on here.Once it is completed that is it, I am finished, time to move on.In a game where you will never complete an "ultimate" goal, well it would be like falling into a black pit.Pretty scary implications if you think about it.I can't buy World of Warcraft as it would destroy my marrage, I just know it!I played Star Wars Galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games.I'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction I was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor, slowly building up my character, stopping only for food and toilet breaks.Seven years ago, I began playing Ultima Online.They were 2 wonderful years and I still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends I had.Something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life.Gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction.I still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning.Online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television, or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates.A minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted.The message to the government is clear, either legalise drugs, or outlaw online gaming!Sounds like there are some sad stories here - and I can believe them all.I am resolute that it will not take over my life.I think I'm obsessed with gaming in general, I spend far too much time playing games like Everquest 2 and Football Manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when I do try to, I'm always thinking in the back if my mind that I'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with Cambridge United.It's not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc..As many of the players spend their time in MMORPGs rather than in front of the TV I fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively.These games are like most things -- too much of anything is a bad thing, but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too, they can be great fun.Nearly most of South Koreans are addicted to online games, and one Korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games.The longest I played was a 24 hour straight session.Can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up...Me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day, we're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a TV, trying to 'frag' some individual...I bought the US version of World of Warcraft when it came out.In future, I'm going to regulate my time far more strictly.Having played MMORPG games for some years I agree that these type of games can be life sucking.Most MMORPG games you need a credit card to play but I dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into.These people are pathetic.24hours, when i was a kid at school and i was on half term, Ultima Online was the game, ahhhh them was the days !
