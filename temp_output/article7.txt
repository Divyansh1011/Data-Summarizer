China net cafe culture crackdown  Chinese authorities closed 12,575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004, the country's government said.Chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools.The official Xinhua News Agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a "safer environment for young people in China".China has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people.China also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to.This is not the first time that the Chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines.All the 100,000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see.Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people.In August 2004 Chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn.
