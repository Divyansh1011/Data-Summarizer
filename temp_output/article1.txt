Apple laptop is 'greatest gadget'  The Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time, by US magazine Mobile PC.The 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first "lightweight" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs.Gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion."In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget," it concluded.Other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position).The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13."Who can forget the crystalline, hiss-free blast of Madonna's Like A Virgin emenating from their first CD player"?Karl Elsener's knife, the Swiss Army Knife from 1891, is at number 20 in the list.The list also contains plenty of oddities: the Pez sweet dispenser (98th), 1980s toy Tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th).Soon they will be subsumed into the PDA's / laptops etc.It paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market.A laptop computer is not a gadget!The Sinclair Executive was the world's first pocket calculator.How about the clockwork radio?Or a pocket calculator?Are the people who created this list insane ?It has revolutionalised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop.Has everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker??Of the electronic gadgets, thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100.A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible.It's out of date - not much of a "gadget".It has to be the mobile phone.The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever.The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980.All top 10 are electronic toys, so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else.Sinclair QL a machine far ahead of its time.The first home machine with a true multi-takings OS.!Apple.a triumph of fashion over..Utter rubbish.But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer 'gadgets' and rank them as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective.The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed.I'd also put Apple's Newton and the first Palm Pilot there as the front runners for portable computing, and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason.I only wish that Vulcan Inc's Flipstart wasn't just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top.What about radios and TVs?By far the most useful gadget.Still wearing and using it a lot!Psion Organiser series 3, should be up there.Case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first, I think).The first mobile PC was voted best gadget by readers of...!It's obviously the mobile phone or remote control, and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.Why?The Psion series 3c!.I too would back the Sinclair Spectrum - without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now.Probably a Nokia model.Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that's what I do for a living now.Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball, which has given way to the largely useless "trackpad" which every notebook on the market today uses.Congratulations to Apple, a deserved win!
