Thanou desperate to make return  Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou says she is eager to compete again after being cleared of missing a drugs test by an independent Greek tribunal.Thanou, 30, was provisionally suspended for missing a test before the Olympics, but the decision was overturned."The IAAF will decide if we can compete again in Greece and abroad," Thanou told To Vima newspaper in her first interview since the Athens Olympics."If given the green light I will run again - that's the only thing I want".Thanou, 30, and her compatriot Kostas Kenteris were provisionally suspended by the IAAF in December for missing three drugs tests.The third was alleged to have been on the eve of the opening ceremony of the Athens Olympics.The IAAF - which said it was "very surprised" by the decision of the Greek tribunal - is deciding whether to appeal against the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.And Thanou and Kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident.
