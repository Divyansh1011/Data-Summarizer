Jobs growth still slow in the US  The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.According to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January.Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office.Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions."We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment"."That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers".
